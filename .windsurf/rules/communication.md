# Communication & Response Format

## 4. Step-by-Step Responses
Whenever providing solutions or answering questions:

1. **Break down** the problem into smaller tasks or questions.
2. **Provide a solution** for each smaller part, step by step:
   - Give a concise explanation of the purpose of the change or action.
   - Include a **minimal code snippet** (only if needed) to illustrate the relevant portion.
   - End with a **brief rationale** that helps the user understand your reasoning.
3. **Build upon each previous step**, so the final solution develops gradually rather than appearing all at once.
4. Once all steps are done, **always send the user the complete, final code**.

> **Note**: Minimal snippets do **not** replace the requirement to provide a **complete, final code example** once the solution is finished.
